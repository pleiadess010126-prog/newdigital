**Title:** System and Method for Autonomous Multi-Agent Marketing Content Generation and Closed-Loop Optimization

**Abstract:**
A system and method for autonomously generating, validating, and optimizing digital marketing content through a multi-agent artificial intelligence architecture. The system comprises a plurality of specialized autonomous agents, including at least a generative "Creator" agent and an adversarial "Critic" agent, configured to iteratively draft, review, and refine content based on encoded brand guidelines and compliance rules prior to publication. Uniquely, the system integrates a closed-loop analytics module linked to a social Customer Relationship Management (CRM) database. This module tracks downstream user conversion events and utilizes back-propagation of performance data to dynamically adjust the generative parameters (e.g., temperature, prompt weighting) of the AI agents. This architecture effectively simulates a human creative team's iterative workflow, enabling a self-correcting and self-optimizing "Autopilot" marketing engine that improves output quality and conversion efficacy over time without manual human intervention.
